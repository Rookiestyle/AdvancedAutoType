In the upper area you can configure the hotkeys Alternate Auto-Type will react on.  
In the lower area you can (de)activate the enhancements to the Auto-Type entry selection.
# Usage
## Auto-Type entry selection enhancements
While the Auto-Type entry selection is a great way to pick one of the matching candidates, it still lacks some features that this plugin adds.

- Sortable columns
- Show database name if entries from more than one database are shown
- Exclude entries in expired groups
- Windows only: Click username / password to only auto-type those - if configured, the Auto-Type entry selection form will stay open

## Auto-Type an alternative sequence
There are quite a few sites that (occasionally) require you to enter different data beside username and/or password, e. g. an OTP, a PIN, ... \
Alternate Auto-Type offers the `{AAT}` placeholder for that.

Example: `{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}{AAT}{S:PIN}{ENTER}`

Global Auto-Type will type {USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}
AAT hotkey will autotype {S:PIN}{ENTER}
Password only hotkey will autotype the password - {ENTER} is optional and the {AAT} placeholder is NOT required in this case

As you can see, AlternateAutoType ensures that only entries having an alternative sequence defined are shown.

## Auto-Type password only
Although KeePass now offers this as one more hotkey out of the box, I decided to keep it a part of this plugin.\
Alternate Auto-Type will let you choose between two options:  
- AutoType the password
- Auto-Type password followed by [ENTER] to automatically submit the login form

## Quick add window titles to Auto-Type sequences  
Alternate Auto-Type offers a shortcut to add window titles to entries' Auto-Type sequences.

Select the entry/entries and pick the window title from the context menu.  
Press [Shift] to directly edit the added sequence.
